# Blog App with React, NodeJS

### Starting note:
To create a full stack blog we can break the task into 3 major tasks:
1. Design a UI.
2. Create the backened and DB.
3. Merge UI with backened & DB. 

Soon I'll break these three major tasks into some more small pieces so that it becomes easier for me to code.



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
